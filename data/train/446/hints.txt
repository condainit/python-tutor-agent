Where should count be initialized so that it accumulates across all loop iterations, not just the last one?
The goal is to scan the tuple and check each of its elements against the list. Which variable should the for loop iterate over?
Does converting the tuple to a set preserve how many times each element appears? What happens to duplicates?
Make sure the function considers all items in the tuple before returning. Where should the return go?
Think about which thing should be “inside” the other. Should we be asking “is the tuple’s item in the list,” or “is the list in the item”?
