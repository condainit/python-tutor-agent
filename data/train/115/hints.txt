Do you need every dictionary to be empty, or just at least one?
What is the truthiness of an empty dictionary in Python, and which predicate matches “all are empty”?
Should you use is or == to compare a dictionary to {}?
Should the function return boolean values True or False, or the strings "True" and "False"?
Where should the return go so that the function considers every dictionary in the list?
