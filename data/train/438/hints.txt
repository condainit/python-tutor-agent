Where should the counter be initialized so that matches from earlier iterations are not erased?
How can you avoid counting the same pair twice and also avoid comparing a tuple with itself?
The goal is to find a pair where one tuple is the reverse of the other, not the same order.
Make sure all pairs are examined before returning the result.
Does removing duplicate tuples change how many bidirectional pairs you should count?
