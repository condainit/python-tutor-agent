Does list.sort return the sorted list, or should you either use sorted(M, key=sum) or sort in place and then return M?
Are you ranking rows by how many elements they have, or by the sum of their elements?
The requirement is ascending order. Should reverse be set here?
Should the key depend on the specific row being compared, or a constant value for all rows?
Do you need the sorted rows themselves, or the positions of those rows?
